# Andes Path

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for Andes Path! We are a team of passionate engineers, designers, and product managers dedicated to building high-quality software and helping businesses scale.

## What We Do

At Andes Path, we specialize in providing top-tier engineering talent and product development services. Our primary offerings include:

* **Staffing:** We provide senior-level engineers, designers, and product managers based in Santiago, Chile, who are available to work US hours. Our team members are hand-picked by CTOs and are ready to start shipping code within a week.
* **Product Coaching:** We offer six-month coaching blocks to mentor PMs and engineer-PM hybrids, helping to improve decision-making and real-world product development skills.
* **Build & Scale:** We can take on entire roadmap slices (or the whole thing) from specification to launch, combining our coaching and staffing services as needed to deliver robust, scalable solutions.

## Our Approach

Our core philosophy is built on a foundation of **product-first thinking, tight feedback loops, and clean, maintainable code**. We don't just work for you; we work with you. We embed ourselves in your team, joining your Slack, participating in stand-ups, and taking ownership of outcomes just like an internal lead.

When our work is done, we leave you with more than just a finished product. We provide **maintainable code, well-documented processes, and a team that is empowered to continue building and iterating without us.**

## Our Team

Our team is composed of experienced professionals with a track record of solving tough problems and delivering exceptional results. Our U.S.-based leadership, combined with our talented team of engineers in Santiago, allows us to provide the perfect blend of strategic oversight and hands-on technical expertise.
